For the course Reinforcement Learning

## Exam Project
The code for the exam project, created in collaboration between vikje24 and ankjo21, can be found in Project/SAC-master and is a modification of tarod13's SAC implementation at https://github.com/tarod13/SAC.

To peroform the same experiment that produced the results of our report, go to Project/SAC-master and run

    run_envs.sh

This will take at least 6 hours on a laptop. No random seeds were used, so you cannot expect to see the same reults.
